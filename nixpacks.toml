# Nixpacks configuration for Railway deployment
# This ensures pnpm is used as the package manager
#
# Set Custom Start Command in Railway dashboard for each service:
#
# FACILITATOR service:
#   cd /app/packages/facilitator && node dist/index.js
#
# EXAMPLE SERVER service:
#   cd /app/examples/server-example && npx tsx src/index.ts

[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs_20", "pnpm"]

[phases.install]

[phases.build]
cmds = ["pnpm -r build"]

# NOTE: No [start] section - set start command per-service in Railway dashboard
